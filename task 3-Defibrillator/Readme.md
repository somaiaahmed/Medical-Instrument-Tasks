# Smart Defibrillator

This project involves designing a smart defibrillator equipped with advanced sensors for real-time monitoring and intervention in cardiac emergencies. The device focuses on early detection of abnormal heart rhythms and provides timely electric shocks when necessary. Additionally, it integrates a mobile application to guide users through the defibrillator's usage.

## Project Goals
- Develop a smart defibrillator circuit capable of detecting abnormal heart rhythms.
- Integrate ECG and temperature sensors for comprehensive patient monitoring.
- Provide real-time data visualization and status updates on a display system.
- Ensure user-friendliness and support through a mobile application with usage instructions.

## Features

### 1. **Defibrillator Circuit Design**
   - **ECG Signal Acquisition**: Develop the necessary circuitry for acquiring ECG signals, enabling accurate detection of heart rhythms.
   - **Shock Delivery Mechanism**: Implement a shock delivery circuit to provide appropriate electrical pulses in case of life-threatening arrhythmias, such as ventricular fibrillation.
   - **Abnormal Rhythm Detection**: The circuit should automatically identify irregular rhythms and trigger the shock mechanism when necessary.

### 2. **Sensor Integration and Display System**
   - **ECG Sensor**: Continuously monitor heart rhythms, allowing for early detection of irregularities.
   - **Temperature Sensor**: Track body temperature as an additional vital sign to monitor patient condition before and after intervention.
   - **Real-Time Data Display**: Provide a visual interface showing heart rhythm and temperature readings, both before and after shock delivery.
   - **Status Updates**: Display the patient's condition, including:
     - Normal heart rhythm
     - Arrhythmia detected
     - Shock delivered
   - **Alarm System**: Visual alerts to inform users of critical states, such as detected arrhythmias requiring immediate action.

### 3. **Smart Features and Mobile Application**
   - **Mobile Application**: An interactive app providing step-by-step instructions for using the defibrillator, aimed at non-medical personnel in emergencies.
   - **Connectivity**: Optionally integrate Bluetooth or Wi-Fi to synchronize data with the mobile app, enabling remote monitoring and guiding users during the procedure.

## Hardware and Components
- **Microcontroller**: The primary controller for processing sensor data, managing the display, and controlling the shock circuit.
- **ECG Sensor Module**: To capture and process heart rhythm data.
- **Temperature Sensor Module**: To track the patientâ€™s body temperature.
- **Alarm and Indicator LEDs**: Visual indicators to alert users of detected arrhythmias.
- **Shock Delivery Circuit**: Safe circuitry to administer the shock when abnormal heart rhythms are detected.
- **Battery System**: Power source capable of supporting all system functions and delivering reliable shocks.

## Software and Mobile App Design
- **Embedded Firmware**: Programmed on the microcontroller, this software will manage:
  - Real-time data processing for ECG and temperature monitoring
  - Signal analysis for arrhythmia detection
  - Control of shock delivery and alarm systems
- **Mobile Application**:
  - Provides instructions and support in operating the defibrillator.
  - Includes simple guidance, visual illustrations, and emergency contact options.
 

## Usage Instructions
1. Place the defibrillator on the patient as instructed in the app.
2. Monitor the display for real-time data on heart rhythm and temperature.
3. Follow prompts on the mobile app to administer the shock, if required.
4. Observe status updates on the display, including warnings and successful shock delivery notifications.

## Future Enhancements
- Add cloud connectivity for remote monitoring and data storage.
- Implement AI algorithms for improved arrhythmia detection.
- Expand mobile app features with detailed emergency guidelines.
