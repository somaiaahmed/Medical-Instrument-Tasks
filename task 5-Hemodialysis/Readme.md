# Hemodialysis Prototype ReadMe

## Project Overview

This project is a **Hemodialysis Prototype** designed to enhance patient safety during hemodialysis treatment. The system monitors multiple parameters such as temperature, flow rate, air bubbles in the circuit, blood leaks, and sudden patient movements using an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). If a sudden movement or abnormal conditions are detected, the system halts the dialysis circuit and raises an alert.

### Key Features:
1. **IMU-based Sudden Movement Detection**:
   - Uses an ADXL345 accelerometer to detect sudden movements, ensuring the system stops if patient motion poses a risk.

2. **Temperature Monitoring**:
   - Tracks fluid temperature using a Dallas DS18B20 sensor. If the temperature exceeds the set threshold (30Â°C), the system triggers an alarm.

3. **Flow Rate Monitoring**:
   - Employs a flow meter to monitor the blood flow rate. An alert is triggered if the flow rate drops below 7.3 L/min.

4. **Air-in-Line Detection**:
   - An LDR sensor identifies air bubbles in the circuit.

5. **Blood Leak Detection**:
   - Uses an RGB color sensor to detect unusual blood leakage in the circuit.

6. **Integrated Alarm System**:
   - Activates a buzzer and halts the pump in response to critical situations.

## How It Works

1. **System Initialization**:
   - Initializes all sensors and components, including the accelerometer and relay module.
   - Outputs initial status messages to the serial monitor.

2. **Real-Time Monitoring**:
   - Continuously monitors:
     - Sudden movements using the IMU.
     - Temperature via DS18B20.
     - Flow rate from the flow meter.
     - Air in the line using the LDR sensor.
     - Blood leaks with the RGB color sensor.

3. **Safety Measures**:
   - If any threshold is exceeded or a sudden movement is detected:
     - Activates the buzzer to alert.
     - Stops the pump relay to pause dialysis.
     - Outputs diagnostic messages to the serial monitor.

## Calibration

1. **Movement Sensitivity**:
   - Adjust `MOVEMENT_THRESHOLD` to tune the sensitivity of sudden movement detection.

2. **Temperature**:
   - Modify `tempThreshold` for the maximum allowable temperature.

3. **Flow Rate**:
   - Update `flowRateThreshold` for the minimum safe flow rate.

4. **LDR Threshold**:
   - Change `ldrThreshold` for air-in-line detection sensitivity.

## Usage

1. **Power On**:
   - Ensure all components are connected and powered.
   - Begin dialysis simulation with the system powered on.

2. **Monitoring**:
   - Allow the system to monitor continuously.
   - Respond to any alarms promptly.

3. **Emergency Stop**:
   - The system will automatically stop the pump and alert when any unsafe condition arises.

## Troubleshooting

- **No Temperature Reading**:
  - Check the DS18B20 connections and ensure the sensor is operational.
- **No Movement Detection**:
  - Verify the I2C connections to the ADXL345 accelerometer.
- **Inaccurate Flow Rates**:
  - Recalibrate the flow meter or inspect for blockages.
