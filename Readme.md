# Medical Instrumentation Tasks

## Task 1
The objective of this project is to acquire ECG data using an ECG sensor or by simulating the ECG circuit. The program calculates the heart rate, determines whether the heart rhythm is regular or irregular, explains the rhythm analysis reasoning, and calculates any errors. Additionally, the ECG signal is visualized and analyzed.

## Task 2
This project involves designing a model of an infant incubator that monitors and displays temperature, humidity, and heart rate. The system includes:
- **Temperature Monitoring**: Triggers an alarm if temperature falls below the desired threshold.
- **Humidity and Heart Rate Monitoring**: Displays real-time values for infant monitoring.
- **Jaundice Detection**: Utilizes a color sensor to detect jaundice symptoms.
- **Bonus Features**:
  - Mobile notifications for abnormal conditions.
  - Additional sensors for monitoring other critical parameters (e.g., oxygen or COâ‚‚ levels).
